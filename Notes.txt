ITERATIONS
All iterations start with uml diagramming and design notes unless otherwise specified or context makes it unapplicable.

*i*
people and things are only associated with individual users
Don't need to use cancan for now.

    *i*
    it seems like there is a lot of duplicate code. Is there a better way to do this?
    ask on the forum
    https://railsforum.com/forum/6-controllers-views/
    http://pathfindersoftware.com/2008/07/drying-up-rails-controllers-polymorphic-and-super-controllers/

*i*
fix committer script so that it pushes new branches
    probably should do it when they're created.
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2765421/how-to-push-a-new-local-branch-to-remote-repo-and-track-it-too

*i*
profile pics with gravatar, use rails girls guide

*i*
setup rspec for what little you've got going
http://guides.railsgirls.com/testing-rspec
http://www.railstutorial.org/
perhaps some other rspec tutorials
users should be only able to access their stuff and people

*i*
sketch a basic ui in pencil and paper
create non-functional html-js ui in app
    acutally, it may not need to be that non-functional
    Where the app asks you for things, don't put it in the database, just make up your own things.
keep tweeking it until you've got it the way you like it
I'm sure this iteration listing will generate many more before I get to the wiki
use sass, partials, and look into using coffeescript

*i*
Bucket
    only "Things I need to do" and "Ready"

*i*
all the buckets

*i*
stopwatch

*i*
Timer and stopwatch, hard-coded pomodoro schedule

*i*
user created work schedules

*i*
user created buckets

*i*
users can share people, tasks, etc.

*i*
adding a habit is a specialized thing
the app helps you monitor how well you are adopting a habit and helps you measure when you have finished adopting it so you can put it in done. But it also monitors the habit to see if you slack off and puts, get back into the habit in your waiting or ready or some other bucket.

*i*
calendar and sync with calendar

*i*
users connect to their people listings if they want
So my listing of my wife will actually be connected to their user account in some way.

*i*
what else do I need to do to make this thing usable/secure?

*i*
start using this thing and make notes about it with it.

*i*
move these notes and others to the github wiki
There are nested task lists
https://github.com/blog/1841-nested-task-lists
Put dia file in wiki as well as a png
This might be a better thing to do than your Notes.txt
Maybe keep ideas in private repo?

*i*
change heroku name to splorf_coach

*i*
learn android and make android app that talks to restful api
from now on any added features are released in concert with the android version

*next?*
Right now, if you're not authorized to see or edit something, you get redirected to the index. Can the user get redirected to whatever previous page they were on?

sync with twitter, facebook, diaspora, tumblr, wordpress and others

integrates with email?
    I'd love to have an empty inbox

write a script for refactoring or find one
    https://railsforum.com/topic/1967-changing-the-column-name-without-having-to-modify-a-bunch-of-other-code/#entry3877
    https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=rails+refactor+script&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8
    post to this forum and maybe make blog post about it.

somehow anonymize user data?

What data do I collect? What are the opt-in-out policies? What is fair? It seems like machine learning could be helpful to users.

do I want to make the user lockable?

track distractions and allow userdefined stats and tracking.

home redirects to a url with static_pages/home, how can I just have it be on the main url?

currently using railsgirls bootstrap css stuff. Use your own. Either use http://www.railstutorial.org/ or some other resource to learn how. There is a bootstrap gem.

add the ability to do video, audio, pictures for things/people

What about pre-release servers on which to test things?

learn how to make vim do html.erb indentation correctly, and fix all files' indentation.
    currently indents by 4, want to indent by 2

look for rails code style guides.

Do I want version numbers in my Gemfile?

read books in more detail:
    kanban
    gtd
    pom
    getting results the agile way
    willpower

research productivity/time-management etc.

QUESTIONS
Do I need to do this?
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  after_action :verify_authorized, :except => :index
end

DESIGN
*intial design*
Person_Or_Thing object
thingness or personness is determined by symbol value
Bucket object
buckets are: things you need/want to do, waiting, ready, doing, done, loved ones, other people
work-break-schedule
timer

**story**
Enter in your things and people (pets are people too)
    enter in all the things you need to do into "things you need to do"
    enter in all the things you want to do into "things you want to do"
    enter in loved ones, aquaintainces, co-workers, add things like bowling buddies
        Loved ones are the most important right now.
    If any of the things you want to or need to do involve people in your life, add them as well.
Pick 5 of what you think the highest priority things are
    Rephrase that thing so you know what the outcome is. What does "done" look like?
    Are they associated with any people? Associate them. Create those people if you haven't yet.
    What other things need to be done, have to happen, for this thing to be done? Put those things in this thing, you may either search for them or create them.
For each thing within each 5 things, look at them, what needs to be done for it? Keep going. Add stuff to calendars. here too.
Then the system looks at the first things that need to be done. These are the tasks that are ready to be done. The stuff that's waiting for this stuff is in the waiting section.
Have the user pick 3 things from the ready section, and then have them estimate how long each of the three things will take.
Now ask them if they'd like to work on it now and if they'd like to time it. Suggest a work/break schedule based on pomodoro. 
Do the thing, if they time things, time it. Work break schedule isn't assigned to any task, and there are multiple schedles (pomodoro, an hour for just working out, 15-3, etc). There's the stopwatch and the timer. There's always the option to keep going for another block or just keep going indefinitely.
keep stats of all this.
Have the person mark a task as done when it's done.
What about estimation, review etc? Will have to think about it.
Do the next thing. Always give them the option to add more things to the new-stuff bucket, take stuff from the new-bucket to waiting, trash, or reference, modify waiting.
There should be a hard limit to the number of things in waiting and ready? There should definitely be a hard limit to the number of wip's. But these should be adjustable?
